Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) is a computer-based technique that helps groups develop graphical representations of complex systems. It's a widely used method for identifying the relationships between elements in a system.
Here are some characteristics of ISM:
Systematic 
ISM provides a systematic way to integrate group judgments into structural models.
Interactive 
ISM is an interactive learning process where groups decide how items are related.  
Graphical 
ISM produces a digraph model that shows the relationships and overall structure of the system.

Here are some steps in the ISM process: 

1. Identify the elements relevant to the problem. 
2. Choose a contextual subordinate relation. 
3. Develop a structural self-interaction matrix (SSIM) based on pairwise comparisons. 
4. Convert the SSIM into a reachability matrix. 
5. Partition the elements and extract the structural model.

ISM can be used to:

• Analyze the driving and dependence power of variables.
• Understand the complexity of a problem.  
• Identify challenges to implementing a process. 
• Develop a course of action for solving a problem.
